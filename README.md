# Image Restoration Using U-Net for Deblurring Distorted Images

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to restore clarity in distorted images using a U-Net based deep learning architecture. We experimented with CNNs and GANs but ultimately found U-Net most effective for preserving fine details and achieving high-quality deblurring results.

## ✅ Final Model: U-Net

### 📐 Architecture
### 🔧 Bottleneck Parameters
- In the U-Net architecture, two configurations were tested for the bottleneck layer:
  - **512 Channels**
  - **1024 Channels**
- These configurations helped analyze the trade-off between performance and GPU memory usage.

- Encoder-Decoder with skip connections.
- Trained using **GPU (CUDA)** for faster execution.
- Used learning rate scheduling and validation-based model saving.
  
### 🧪 Performance-Channel-512
- **Training Loss:** 0.0230
- **Best Validation PSNR:** 30.85
- **Best Validation SSIM:** 0.9229

### 🧪 Performance-channel-1024
- **Best Validation PSNR:** 30.90
- **Validation Loss:** 0.0198
- **Training Loss:** 0.0205
- **Best Validation SSIM:** 0.9261
  

### ⚙️ Technical Considerations
- Reduced batch size to manage GPU memory constraints.
- High memory usage due to deep architecture and multiple channels.
- Long training time on CPU initially, later optimized using GPU.
